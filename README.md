# Webpage Sidenotes

## What it does

This  adds a sidebar that lets you take notes on the current web page. The notes are saved to local storage, and the notes for each page are shown again when you open that page again.

The sidebar also uses the `commands` manifest key, so you can also open it using Ctrl+Shift+Y in WIndows and Cmd+Shift+Y in Mac.
